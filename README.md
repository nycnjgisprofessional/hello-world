# hello-world
My first github repository
Hi gang!
I'm a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Specialist who has been learning Python in his spare time and is finally getting his 'feet wet' with GitHub for the first time. I originally came on here to explore Python code as part of an exercise from Zed Shaw's 'Learning Python the Hard Way' book, but came across this Github 'hello world' tutorial and decided to use this opportunity to learn more about GitHub.
